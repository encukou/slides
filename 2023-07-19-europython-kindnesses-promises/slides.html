                        Thank you, Mia, for the introduction.

                        Hello!

                        I am Petr Viktorin, here's my username on the internet,
                        and as Mia mentioned, this is my story.

                        First, a little bit about myself.
                        ... actually, this whole talk will be about myself,
                        my journey and the lessons learned.
                        Let's start at the beginning.

                        Notes:
                        I was born in Brno, about 200 km that way ---> (east of here) in the city of Brno.
                        I was lucky to have a computer in the family, which wasn't common at the time,
                        and a dad who knew how to use it.
                        I had the perfect environment to start programming -- at six years old.

                        {Q} How many of you speak English as a second language?
                        I guess most of you know English is pretty much a pre-requisite
                        for programming.
                        You might find stuff in other languages, but most documentation and tutorials
                        are English-first.

                        Notes:
                        If you live in an English-speaking country, you have a head start when you want
                        to go into computer programming.
                        I was lucky enough to get second best thing:
                        When I was ten, my dad got a job in the US,
                        and moved there with the whole family.
                        I learned English, with basically no effort.

                        Looking back, I realize I've been incredibly lucky.
                        I had access to a computer very early on,
                        I learned English by no fault of my own,
                        I could take risks: when something went wrong, my family had my back:
                        I had a safety net.
                        Now can return the favour -- be part of a safety net for my family.

                        So, as talk about my achievements, take them with a grain of salt.                  # ?????
                        It's not a fair race; I had an unfair advantage.
                        By pure chance I happened to pick a hobby that can now feed me and my family,
                        I got everything I needed to get good at it,
                        I always looked like stereotypical computer nerd,
                        and I can't really understand what
                        kind of advantages I got that way.

                        The university I went to had an international Master student programme,
                        and I stayed and finished my degree here.
                        My Czech university wasn't too happy about that, unfortunately.

                        Then, I realized where my home is, and moved right back to Brno.

                        When researching what life would be like in Finland, I found Honza -- someone
                        from Brno who went on Erasmus to Finland a few years before me.
                        At the time, he was starting to learn Python, today... we'll he'll be on this
                        stage on Friday.
                        In 2011, he had a conversation that went something like this:

                        Half a year later, when I returned home for good, I had a talk,
                        and some time afterward, when Honza was busy, I started co-organizing.
                        That freed Honza's hands to think up crazy ideas, like expand to other cities.
                        We literally went to Ostrava to look for a venue, then organized a meetup
                        there, and recruited LumÃ­r to organize the next ones.
                        We felt like missionaries.

                        Anyway.
                        In Czech, a traditional meeting with friends is called Â«jÃ­t na pivoÂ» â literally,
                        go for a beer.
                        You can also say Â«jÃ­t na jednoÂ» Â­go for one (beer) â that's been called the
                        biggest Czech lie, as it's never just one.
                        Another Czech lesson: the letters I and Y are pronounced exactly the same.
                        Hence, the name of the Czech meetup: Pyvo.
                        Our friends of Slovakia thought of it first, but it stuck here, and the
                        Prague Python meetup adopted the name in a few months.

                        Pyvo is too good of a pun, but drinking is not mandatory.
                        I don't dring alcohol myself, and I've always felt welcome at the
                        meetups -- even the ones I didn't organize.
                        If you know the Czech culture, you'll know that is actually pretty special:
                        usually you get really annoying questions like âwhy?â or âso you're drivingâ
                        or worst of all, âare you pregnant?â
                        Well, not here. Not so much, anyway.
                        For me, that's a tiny sample of how the Python community being welcoming to
                        people who are different.

                        // Lanyrd, Facebook, Twitter and Meetup.com

                        And since I've organized one for many years, I can share a few tips.

                        * Start.
                            * If you want to meet peope that are interested in something, the best way to do it is join their meeting. If there's no such meething, find a few and start the meeting.
                        * Minimalism with bonuses.
                            * It's a meeting of people interested in Python.
                        * Anything else is a bonus:
                            * Other people.
                            * Speakers and talks.
                            * A projector.
                            * Recordings.
                            * Food.
                            * Sponsored food.
                            * A public announcement.
                            * Spreading to other cities
                        * Seek help.
                           * You can't do everything alone.
                           * When became too much for Honza, he asked for a co-organizer.
                             At that point I was already back home, so I said yes -- and organized
                             for many years, even after Honza moved to Prague.
                             Eventually I grew tired, I asked for other organizers -- and found them.
                             Now Brno Pyvo is thriving without me, though I try to help whenever they
                             ask me.
                        * Own your data
                        * Through the years, Pyvo meetups were advertised on Lanyrd, Facebook, Twitter and Meetup.com. What do these platforms have in common?
                            * You can't export historical data from them.
                            They're gone, unsearchable, or slowly monetizing access.
                        * So, put your info in a Git repository, even if that's not the place you promote.
                            Our website is a very minimal frontent to a bunch of YAML files that started
                            out as a Lanyrd export.
                            By now it records almost a decade of monthly meetups in 3 cities,
                            and less frequent ones elsewhere.
                        * Keep it regular.
                        * Pyvo meetups are every month, every last Thursday.
                        * Even if only two people show up, you can have an interesting conversation.
                        * If there's a schedule, people will remind you that *there should be a meetup this month!*

                        For example, Prague Pyvo is every third Wednesday of the month.
                        Always. For more than a decade. They skipped one month when COVID hit.
                        As luck would have it, today's a third Wednesday, and so we meet: this
                        evening about 500 meters *that way*! You're welcome to join.

                        At this point I worked with Lynn Root, a co-founder of PyLadies,
                        who attempted to start a Czech chapter, but didn't find enough interested
                        women.
                        Sure enough, women were missing from all our meetups.
                        We were missing a lot of other types of people, too, but this seemed like
                        a good place to start: if there aren't any PyLadies, let's help train some!

                        It started with this post on Facebook:

Someone was struggling with a Python course at a university,
and wanted to pay for a tutor.
I've just returned from the missionary trips to another city to find more
people who wanted to talk about Pyhon, and the idea of getting paid for
such a thing seemed pretty... alien.

I started tutoring, helping them with their homework and preparing for an exam,
and quickly found out why they were struggling.
The course was designed for students of information technology, for people who
were interested in computer science.
It explored nifty algorithms and interesting mathematical puzzles -- but it
was taught to future librarians, who weren't interested in that at all.

We used a meeting room at Red Hat, which was empty in the evenings,
and didn't need much budget or organization.

We had a feedback session when the semester ended, and a few of the attendees
convinced me to keep teaching. But this time, it wouldn't be helping with
homework: I'd ask them what they want to do with Python, and explain whatever
concepts were necessary to get there.
There was no fixed agenda, no end date, we just continued as long as people
wanted to come.

Honza had a running joke about what you should use Python for:

> That is, of course, an important milestone in any programmer's life.

You need to know a lot for that: how variables work, how to save a file,
install an HTTP library, debugging, and so on.

                      <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
I think stumbled upon a great way to make such a course:
* Pick a target audience, and invite them.
* Start teaching to 3-5 people, with an end result in mind,
  and explain everything they don't know.
  It will take more sessions than you think.
* Write down roughly what you told them, so if someone missed
  a session they can get back to speed.
* When done, pick another task.

People gradually dropped out, finding out this wasn't for them or exploring
other duties, and one day we called the experiment done.

                    </ul>

                      <aside class="notes" data-markdown>

I looked back at the notes, now knowing what people liked to build,
what I need to explain, and how much time it takes to explain -- and started
again, this time with a plan and an end date.
I reached out to some colleagues to come and help the attendees with
their problems.
And I improved my notes *before* each lesson, turning them from notes to myself
into something you could learn from directly -- without an instructor.

The next year, people from Prague took my notes and taught their own course.

                    </ul>
                      <aside class="notes" data-markdown>

The year after that, I stepped down as organizer.
The former attendees reserved a room, ran registration, and did all the little
things needed to run a free course for 30 people.
I just came to teach and improve the written lessons.

There's a lot of things to do to teach a bigger course.
But now PyLadies CZ manage to do it consistently, on a volunteer basis.
It's actually pretty hard for company to sponsor this: all they need is
a meeting room for some evenings.

Here's how it works:

* diagram

And some takeaways:

* Teach!
  Explaining something to 3 people does wonders to organize your thoughts.
* Take notes!
  You'll eventually want to refer back to what you said before.
* Share notes!
  Even if they're incomplete -- even an outline of a course can help someone
  else teach the same thing.
* Skip the grading
  You don't need to score anyone's performance.
  Do assign tasks,

He later said a lot more.
In 2018, he gave a talk and a blog post called
âSetting expectations in Community Participationâ,
and, I confess, I'll basically take that and condense it into 5 minutes.
I'm allowed to do that in a lightning talk, right?

Everyone in this community is a volunteer.
Every open source project you use -- Python itself, NumPy, Django,
Pytest, Textual -- was made by someone volunteering their spare time.
Or maybe someone paid them to do it -- but it probably wasn't you paying for it.
(If it was, *thank you* -- read your contract instead of listening to me.)

Everything you use has a cost: someone chose to spend their time building it.
Or some company spent its employee's time -- same thing.

And so, everything you use is a *gift*, freely given -- usually with an
invitation to make it better for everyone.
And that's the mindset we should 

Everything in open source(community) should be a series of kindnesses

## Using open source

> It *can* be like someone leaving out a pamphlet you **find offensive**.

> It *should* be like sharing a toy at the playground.

## Providing feedback

> It *can* be like someone telling you, "**you're stupid**".

> It *should* be suggesting a better way to do something.

## Submitting a contribution

> It *can* be like someone trying to give you a puppy you didn't ask for
> or saying, "I'm cleaning up your mess".

> It *should* be more of suggesting a better way to do something.

## Contribution feedback

> It *can* be like someone saying, "**you're doing it wrong**"
> or reacting with "why don't you love me?!?"

> It *should* be welcoming
> or a teaching moment
> or an acknowledgment that you don't have time -- and an invitation to
  take over the project or start a new fork.

## Maintenance

> It *can* be like **arguing about politics** with friends.

> It *should* be like decorating a house.

# NOTHING IN RETURN

Most importantly,
a *kindness* should not come with an expectation of something in return.

## Giving a talk

> It *can* be like **mandatory compliance training** you need to sit through.

> It *should* be sharing ideas.

## Organizing a meetup

> It *can* be like ?

## Teaching a course

> It *can* be like ?

There are times when you *can* expect something:

When I *promise* to do something, then you can expect me to do it.
It's giving myself an extra challenge.
It makes it possible to plan your work.

It's quite important that promises -- large and small -- are kept.

For example, I promised to give this keynote. And so I'm here.
I could have given up when the talk just wasn't coming together
as I wanted it to.
The reason I didn't is that I made a promise to the organizers,
and by extension, to all of you.
I didn't sign a contract to be here.
The only thing that would happen if I didn't show up is that this community
couldn't trust me any more.
And that is, of course, reason enough.

Of course, there are reasons to break a promise.
If I broke my leg and was in the hospital, I'd excuse myself
and you all would have to talk among yourselves for an hour instead of
listening to me.
If my wife called and asked me to come back, for any reason, same thing.

But that's about it -- there isn't much else that would make me break
a promise to the community.

Some promises are even bigger.
You can promise to organize a conference.
Or a meetup, or a course.
You can sign up as a Python release manager,
or run for the board of the Python Software Foundation.
All these are big commitments, and failing to keep the promise
would affect many people.
Exceptions happen, but they're pretty serious, and if we got
too many of them the community would fall apart.

And yet, what do you get for making and keeping these promises?
Well, they're all interactions with the community.
To use Brett's word, they're kindnesses.
You can't expect anything in return -- except maybe a warm feeling
that you did something nice for others.

But there are also smaller promises to make.

If I say âI'll do the review this weekâ, that's a promise.
It gives you an idea of what to expect; and if I don't get to it,
you have every right to be angry at me.

If the maintainer of project you depend on says they'll
release Tuesday on the 14th,
you can plan how you'll update and test the dependency to meet your
own deadlines.

I must be honest: I'm far from perfect in keeping these small promises.
But I try, and I invite you to try as well: treat comments
like âI'll get to this tomorrowâ as promises.
Check your calendar before making the comment.
Mark it in your calendar, so you don't forget.
And if you don't get to it, treat it as a mistake.
Apologize, think how you can prevent the mistake in the future,
and move on.

                      <aside class="notes" data-markdown>

And lastly, make fewer promises.
If you're not sure you can do something, say stuff like:
* I'd love to work on that, but I definitely won't get to it this month.
* I'll put it on my TODO list, but that list is getting pretty long.
* If anyone beats me to it, go ahead!

Or my favourite:
* I won't get to it myself, but if you think it's interesting I'd love to help
  and mentor you.


... which is actually a rather big promise -- mentoring someone usually takes
much more time than doing something yourself.
But, for me at least, it's also much more rewarding.

Perhaps I like sharing my knowledge even better than sharing my source code.
If you do too, you're at the right place, at the right time.

And if you don't -- welcome!
