Talk for Brno Pyvo

should have been a lightning talk, but was about 15-20 minutes :(

* demo.py - what I presented
* notes.py - what I wanted to present (I copied from here)
* parse-tree.png - illustration of the parse tree
* my_ast.py - the Abstract Syntax Tree structures
* tokenizer.py - a simple regex-based tokenizer
* notes.txt - various notes
* hr.py - a gimmick I didn't use :)
