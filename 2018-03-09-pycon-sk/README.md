### Fair use              

Some images are used without permission from their owners,                                                
with hope that displaying them qualifies as "fair use" when used                                          
in supporting visual material for a conference talk. 
(NB: this this may not apply to other uses of the slides.)                                                

Logos of organizations, projects and products are used to visually                                        
identify these entities when commenting on them.     
I do not claim ownership of the logos, and they're not covered by                                         
the CC-BY-SA license.     

A diagram from the 1979 paper "Design of LISP-based Processors"                                           
by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. & Gerald Ray Sussman is used to illustrate                                        
academic approach to information theory/computer science.                                                 
Again I do not claim ownership of the diagram, and it is not covered                                      
by the CC-BY-SA license.
