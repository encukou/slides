The stories of Python features

Python 3.11 is almost ready. The Release Candidate is available, all
features are in, and fixes for serious bugs are the only changes
allowed before the final release in October. So you can already play
with better traceback inforrmation, exception groups, performance
improvements, tomllib, and so on.

But have you ever wondered how these features get into the language?
If you have an idea of an improvement, what needs to happen before
it's implemented and released to the world? Who needs to be convinced
that it's a good idea? What kind of questions do you need to ask and
answer?
Find out in this talk.
